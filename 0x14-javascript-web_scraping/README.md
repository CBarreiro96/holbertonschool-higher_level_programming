	<summary>:hammer_and_wrench:<b>How to create an object in Javascript.</b></summary>
	<br/>
    An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions â€” which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.) Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable. <br>
**For example:**

```javascript
    const objectName = {
    member1Name: member1Value,
    member2Name: member2Value,
    member3Name: member3Value
    };
```
